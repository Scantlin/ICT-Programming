# WELCOME TO STI HACKATHON 2025-2026

---
## THIS REPO WILL STAND AS OUR CODEBASE

---
That sounds like an exciting challenge! Since the hackathon rules only allow **AI prompt-driven development** (no manual coding), the competition will likely revolve around how effectively you can **communicate instructions** to AI tools to build your app. This means **prompt engineering**, **planning**, and **division of tasks** are key.

---

### âœ… GOAL OF THIS PREP

* Help you **simulate the hackathon experience**.
* Help you practice **prompting AI** to build a full application.
* Restrict your **tech stack** to make the challenge more focused and realistic.
* Offer guidance on **collaboration, ideation, and debugging prompts**.

---

## ðŸ§  PHASE 1: CHOOSE YOUR TEXTSTACK

Here's your **TextStack** â€” the technologies you're allowed to reference in prompts (i.e., what the AI is allowed to use to generate code):

---

### ðŸ”§ Tech Stack (TextStack) â€” "Prompt-Only Mode"

You must prompt the AI to build **everything** using only the following technologies:

* **Frontend**:

  * Framework: **React (with Tailwind CSS)**
  * Components/UI: **shadcn/ui** (component library)
  * Charts (optional): **Recharts**
  * Animations: **Framer Motion**

* **Backend**:

  * Framework: **Express.js**
  * Runtime: **Node.js**

* **Database**:

  * **MongoDB** (via Mongoose ORM)

* **Authentication**:

  * **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** or **Clerk/Auth0** (simplified auth tools)

* **Deployment**:

  * **Vercel** (Frontend)
  * **Render** (Backend)

* **APIs/Extras**:

  * **OpenAI API** (GPT or Whisper)
  * **LangChain** (for AI chaining if needed)
  * **Pinecone** (optional for vector search)
  * **Cloudinary** (for media uploads)

## ðŸ§ª PHASE 2: SIMULATION PRACTICE

### Let's simulate a mini-hackathon task right now.

**Challenge**:

> Create a web app that allows users to generate personalized bedtime stories for their kids using AI. Parents enter the child's name, age, interests, and a moral lesson, and the app returns a custom story. Users can save stories and read them later.

You now need to:

1. Plan the features.
2. Assign roles (frontend, backend, AI prompt design).
3. Start prompting me (ChatGPT) like Iâ€™m your dev assistant who can only generate code via prompts.

---

## ðŸ‘¥ Division of Roles (Recommended)

You 3 can divide roles like this:

| Role                         | Tasks                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prompt Lead** (PM)         | Plans structure, coordinates prompt instructions   |
| **Frontend Prompt Engineer** | Prompts UI layout and design components            |
| **Backend Prompt Engineer**  | Prompts DB schemas, API routes, AI API integration |

Each person types and iterates on **prompts** for their domain.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Your Next Move

If you're ready, reply with:

* Roles youâ€™ll each take.
* How you'd like to proceed: Start the story app simulation or pick your own idea.

I'll walk you through how to prompt each part efficiently.

Letâ€™s build something amazingâ€”**prompt by prompt**.
